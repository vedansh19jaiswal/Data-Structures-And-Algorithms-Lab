two separate doors for exit. Passengers can occupy seats in front or rear
sections of bus on first in first out basis. The entry door automatically gets
closed when bus is full and alarms for the same. Passengers once occupied the
seat are not asked to change it. Identify the best data structure that can be
used and implement the program.
